# Jodete
This game was created as an assignment for the course Ideation & Prototyping (Spring 2018), taught by the Integrated Digital Media department at NYU Tandon.
<br><br>
It's inspired by Diego Lattanzio's card game app "Jodete" (available on app stores). I wanted to see if I could code a version of the game, as similar to Lattanzio's as possible. <br><br>
